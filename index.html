            Hello! I'm Aaron Lee, a 25-year-old performance marketing expert currently working as a senior media buyer at a performance marketing agency. 
            With a keen eye for optimizing Facebook ads and monitoring key metrics like cost per lead, cost per click, and cost per mille, I strive to ensure our campaigns hit their benchmarks and deliver exceptional results.
            <br><br>
            When I'm not diving into the world of digital marketing, I love exploring my diverse interests. 
            I'm passionate about mixed martial arts and engage in kickboxing exercises five times a week. 
            Football is another sport I enjoy, whether it's playing a match with friends or following the latest games. 
            Traveling is a significant part of my life, as I love discovering new places and cultures. 
            <br><br>
            Recently, I've embarked on a new journey in writing, focusing on stories and fiction. 
            This creative outlet allows me to express myself in new ways and share my imaginative narratives with the world.
            <br><br>
            In my professional life, I've also ventured into entrepreneurship. 
            I own an online sportswear brand called PANTHEONX Sports, where we primarily sell running shorts. To boost our reach, I've established an affiliate network, providing resources and content ideas to our affiliates to help them grow.
            <br><br>
            My goal is to buy a Subaru BRZ, a dream I'm working hard to achieve. 
            I'm also committed to improving the profitability of my sportswear business by exploring new revenue streams without increasing prices for our products.
            <br><br>
            Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my work, projects, hobbies, and the latest updates in my journey. Let's connect and grow together!
